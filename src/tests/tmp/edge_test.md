# Edge Creation Test

## Issue Analysis:
1. **Edge count increases** but **no edges in Redux state**
2. **Edges not visible** in graph visualization
3. Need to identify where edge count is actually coming from

## Test Steps:
1. Open browser at http://localhost:3001
2. Select a system and activate "Edit System"
3. Create two nodes via Ctrl+click  
4. Try to create edge by dragging from border of one node to another
5. Check browser console for:
   - Edge creation events
   - Redux state updates
   - Edge count source
   - GraphViewerMapper output

## Expected Console Output:
- `🔗 Edge created between: sourceId -> targetId`
- `💾 Adding edge to Redux state: {...}`
- `🔍 Redux state after edge creation - edges: X nodes: Y`
- `🔍 Redux edges: [{...}]`

## Current Status:
- JavaScript syntax error resolved
- UI server running on :3001
- Backend issues with import path (not critical for this test)
